=═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Flit Format:
  - Total Size:   256 bytes
  - Header:       16 bytes (protocol, opcode, address, etc.)
  - Data Payload: 240 bytes
  - Protocol:     CXL.mem (memory protocol)


========================================================================
 TEST: Pattern 1: Sequential Read (Streaming)                      
========================================================================

Scenario: Reading consecutive 4KB pages (typical memory streaming)
Expected: Cache prefetcher should kick in after first miss
